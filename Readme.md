## 🌟 Introduction
This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, tries, as well as classical algorithms such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, and backtracking.

Feel free to explore each directory for detailed explanations, implementations, and usage examples.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure
- **Data Structures**: Contains directories for each data structure with implementation files and tests.
- **Algorithms**: Contains directories for each algorithm with implementation files and tests.
